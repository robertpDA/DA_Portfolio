# Data Analysis Portfolio

## About This Repository
Welcome to my **Data Analysis Portfolio**! This repository is a collection of projects that showcase my skills in data analysis, using tools like **Excel**, **SQL**, **Tableau** and more. Each project in this repository represents different aspects of data analysis, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and insights extraction.

## Data Visualization
In addition to data analysis, I build **interactive dashboards** using **Tableau** to visualize trends and insights.

## About `.gitattributes`
The `.gitattributes` file is used to configure Git LFS (Large File Storage) for this repository. It ensures that large files, such as `Real_Estate_Sales_2001-2021_GL.csv`, are managed efficiently by storing them outside of the main repository and replacing them with lightweight references.
